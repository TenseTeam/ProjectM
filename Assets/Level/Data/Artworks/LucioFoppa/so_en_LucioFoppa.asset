  Description: 'Ambrogio Figino or Figini or Giovanni Ambrogio Figino was an Italian
    mannerist painter.

    A pupil of Giovan Paolo Lomazzo from 1564, Figino came
    to prominence in the Milanese artistic panorama initially as a portraitist. The
    effigy of Ambrogio Annoni, one of the few portraits that can be confidently attributed
    to him, shows a meticulous ability to render details worthy of Flemish painting.
    In the early 1680s the artist received the commission from the Jesuits for two
    altarpieces, once in San Fedele: the Madonna della Serpe (of which Michelangelo
    Merisi da Caravaggio will be remembered; 1581-1583) and the ''Coronation of the
    Virgin (1585-1586).

    Figino''s Roman journey probably dates back to these
    years; in the Eternal City it was Michelangelo''s art, in addition to the study
    of antiquity, that was decisive for his education, as is evident from his later
    paintings, such as the beautiful Saint Matthew and the Angel, also reinterpreted
    in a next painting by Caravaggio. The altarpiece with Saint Ambrose defeating
    Arius dates back to 1590 and is now in the Pinacoteca di Brera (another autograph
    version is in the church of Sant''Eustorgio).'
