  Name: Saint Peter
  Description: The figure of the saint emerges with the solidity of a polychrome
    sculpture, resting on a fractured ground that isolates it like a pedestal. Beyond
    this, a fantastic landscape opens up with precarious arches framing plains traversed
    by rivers and dotted with constructions. This landscape representation lends
    the painting an evocative character and contributes to its significance within
    the artistic context of the Ferrarese Renaissance.
