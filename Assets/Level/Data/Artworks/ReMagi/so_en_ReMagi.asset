  Name: Adorazione dei Re Magi
  Description: 'The work was commissioned for the Venetian church of Sant''Elena
    by Donna Orsa, widow of Simone di Malipiero and Jacopo Palma the Elder who was
    born in Serina in the province of Bergamo, but who had followed his family to
    the lagoon city from a young age.

    The canvas depicts the exact evangelical
    story of the adoration of the characters from the East, with the presence of
    Saint Helena depicted with the classic iconography holding the cross, a character
    certainly not present at the birth of Christ. Legend has it, however, that it
    was she who found the relics of the holy cross. The depiction of the saint confirms
    her original placement as the altarpiece of the main altar of the Venetian church
    where she was the owner.'
