  Description: "Before the suppression, the Church of San Nicol\xF2 ai Frari preserved
    an important cycle of paintings by Veronese, which was unfortunately dismembered
    and dispersed in different locations: this cycle attests to the master's maturity
    but also to his last great undertaking of a religious nature. As regards the
    chronology, it is hypothesized on the basis of the date of reconsecration of
    the church in 1582 and the lack of notations on the cycle of paintings in the
    Sansovino Guide of 1581.\r\nIn this work, Veronese shows off his ability to stage
    complex representations by exploiting theatrical expedients, such as plays of
    light or exasperated gestures. The iconography of the painting brings together
    the two subjects of the Baptism and the Temptations of Christ. The Christ baptized
    by the Baptist and surrounded by angels is moved completely to the left, in a
    fumigation of lights starting from the dove of the Holy Spirit. Around there
    is a dense leafy scrub, broken by rays that descend from above, creating luminous
    effects in the iridescent folds of the robes. The entire right area, more than
    half of the painting, is intended for viewing the landscape, in which Christ
    is tempted by Satan: the figures are small in the humid and foggy atmosphere."
