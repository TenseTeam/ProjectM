  Description: "The work is not documented by ancient sources. It has been known
    with certainty since 1826, when it was mentioned in a guide to the city of Brescia,
    and it is probable that it came from elsewhere: in 1829, in fact, the artist
    was in Sal\xF2 to paint the painting with Saint Anthony of Padua and a donor
    , still in the Cathedral today. It is therefore assumed that the Presentation
    was painted for a client from the Garda area.\r\nIt has been located in Brera
    since 1923."
