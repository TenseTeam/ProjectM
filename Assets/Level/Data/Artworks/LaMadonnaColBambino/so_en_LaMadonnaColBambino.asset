  Description: The first evidence of the painting is in a document relating to the
    placement of the altarpiece with "St. Ambrose defeating the Arians" - destined
    for the Palazzo dei Mercanti now the Civic Museums of the Castle - dated 25 January
    1590, where it is said to have been created "shortly before". Shortly afterwards
    Comanini (1591) describes the work, exalting the symbolic contrast between Lucifer
    and Saint Michael and highlights the usual complex work of the artist whose work
    is the result of an elaborate and complex synthesis of elements taken from authoritative
    models.
