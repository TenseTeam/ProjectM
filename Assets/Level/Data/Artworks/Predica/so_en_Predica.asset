  Description: The work is a canvas originally intended for the hall of the Scuola
    Grande di San Marco, one of the most powerful and prestigious in Venice. It is
    one of the largest canvases that exist, with a surface area of twenty-six square
    metres, as well as one of the richest in narrative and iconographic ideas. The
    cycle of canvases with stories from the life of Saint Mark was completed much
    later, almost sixty years later, by Giorgione and Tintoretto, and is today divided
    between the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan and the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice.
