  Description: The painting arrived in Brera in 1809 together with three other paintings
    also by Campi, the "Greengrocer", the "Fishmongers" and the "Chicken sellers",
    following the Napoleonic suppression of the Gerlimite convent of San Sigismondo
    in Cremona where they had been present together since 1798 to other paintings
    ("The sweeper of the house so called San Martino", the "Mangiaricotta" and other
    perhaps autograph works), in the guesthouse room of the convent, as reported
    in the inventory drawn up by the pro-treasurer Father Bonifacio Maria Luccasetti.
