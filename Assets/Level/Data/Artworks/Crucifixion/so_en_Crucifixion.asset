  Description: The work's original location and commissioner are unknown; the former
    may have been Milan Cathedral or the church of Santa Maria in Brera. The panel
    might have been kept in storage due to its unorthodox iconography. Some theorise
    that it was produced in the milieu of religious reform movements current in Milan
    during its occupation by the French (later opposed by Carlo Borromeo and the
    Counter-Reformation), or that it was directly commissioned by Marshal Gian Giacomo
    Trivulzio, the city's governor on behalf of the French, who had also commissioned
    the cartoons for the Trivulzio tapestries from Bramantino.
